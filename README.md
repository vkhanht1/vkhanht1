<h1 align="center">👨‍🚀 Hi, I'm Khanh </h1>
<h3 align="center">Final-year Computer Science Student | Web Developer | Software Engineering </h3>

💻 I love building full-stack applications using **MERN Stack** and **Spring Boot**, and exploring how AI can enhance development workflows.  

🚀 My projects include:
- **Restaurant Table Reservation System** — a full-featured web app built with *Spring Boot* and *React*.
- **MERN Bookstore Website** — an e-commerce platform with *JWT Authentication* and *PayPal Payment Integration*.
- Other side projects focusing on testing, automation, and REST API design.

🧠 I’m currently expanding my skills in **software testing**, **web performance optimization**, and **modern frontend design patterns**.  
🌱 I continuously learn through Coursera and Codecademy courses in testing and web technologies.

Outside of coding, I’m curious about how technology shapes everyday life and I enjoy creative UI design, tech communities, and sharing knowledge with others.
